Welcome to our first blog post üëã

We wanted to give a bit of background to the practice of astrology and how our approach at Cosmos Divina differs from traditional practices. This is the first post in a series of posts about the technology behind Cosmos Divina.

At its core, astrology is about making predictions using the alignment of stars at birth. As such, the tagline ‚ÄúThe art of prediction‚Äù has won its way with astrology.

The art of prediction is one that has fascinated people for centuries. Traditional astrologers use a variety of techniques and methods to make predictions about a person's future, the most popular being birth chart analysis, planetary/stellar transits, and progressions. Let us take a look at these analyses.

A birth chart, also known as a natal chart, is a map of the sky at the exact moment of a person's birth. Astrologers use this chart to gain insight into a person's character, potential, and life path. By analyzing the positions of the planets at the time of birth, astrologers make predictions about a person's future. These predictions are generally long-term focused, but also form the basis of a person‚Äôs zodiac sign and hence the recurring release of daily, weekly, monthly or yearly horoscopes as we will see when explaining the use of transits and progressions.

Planetary and/or stellar transits refer to the current positions of the planets and how they interact with the positions of the planets in a person's natal chart. By analyzing these interactions, astrologers make predictions about the influences and events that are likely to occur in a person's life. Given the transitory nature of these forecasts, they are typically focused on the shorter term.

Finally, progressions is another method of prediction that astrologers use, it is a technique that involves moving the planets in a natal chart forward in time to analyze potential future influences.

While these are traditional practices for astrologers, we at Cosmos Divina have taken a modern approach to astrology and have leveraged the work done within machine learning and artificial intelligence to provide astrological insights into the 12 zodiacs. Machine learning and artificial intelligence have greatly advanced over recent years. This is evident in stats such as those found on Hugging Face, an AI community building the future of ML/AI, which as of January 2023 bolters more than 123,871 machine learning models ready for consumption.

What we have done at Cosmos Divina is to leverage the colossus of astrological knowledge available in written English and have trained artificial intelligence models to be able to provide universal, love, career, and health horoscopes to help our users navigate life.

We have coined this new field ‚ÄúAIstrology‚Äù as the intersection of artificial intelligence and astrology.

Future blog posts will explore this topic in greater detail. Stay tuned!

Of course, it needs to be said that our predictions and astrology in general should not be used to make important decisions or to predict specific events. Astrology is a tool for self-awareness and understanding, not a guarantee of the future. Astrologers and Cosmos Divina‚Äôs models can provide guidance and insight, but ultimately, it's up to the individual to take responsibility for their own life and choices.
