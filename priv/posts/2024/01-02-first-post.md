Geospatial data describes the "where" in the world around us. Every business has a "where" dimension to it. A trucking operator monitors its trucks on a map via GPS data. A retailer reviews potential sites for a new store from spatial customer data. A city is monitoring which households get water from each of its waterworks. The examples are endless, yet it is incredibly hard to work with geospatial data, often requiring the use of old-school, clunky desktop programs or the development of home-grown solutions with open-source packages.  

To address the lack of powerful, user-friendly tools, we are launching znow - a blazing-fast, high-performance online geospatial processing engine and API. Our aim is to offer a user-friendly, instantly accessible suite of comprehensive geospatial and GIS-related tools and functionalities, all available as a cloud-hosted solution directly in your browser.
We have limited spots available for beta users. Sign up below.
